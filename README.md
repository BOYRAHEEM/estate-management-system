## Customization

### Adding New Housing Types
To add new housing types beyond the default three:

2. **Via API**: Use the POST endpoint to add new types
3. **Via Code**: Modify the `defaultHousingTypes` array in `server.js`

### Styling Customization
- Modify `styles.css` for visual changes
- The design uses CSS custom properties for easy color scheme changes
- Responsive design works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Feature Extensions
The modular architecture allows for easy extension:
- Add new inventory categories
- Implement room booking system
- Add maintenance scheduling
- Integrate with external systems

## Security Considerations

- Input validation on both frontend and backend
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- Data sanitization for user inputs

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Change port in server.js or use environment variable
   PORT=3001 npm start
   ```

2. **Database Issues**
   - Delete `estate_management.db` to reset the database
   - Restart the server to recreate tables

3. **Dependencies Issues**
